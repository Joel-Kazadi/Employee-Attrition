In this project, we will analyze the reasons behind employee attrition in order to identify the main factors contributing to employee attrition. The aim is to gain a better understanding of the root causes of these departures, in order to propose appropriate improvement strategies and measures.

We will look at various aspects, such as working conditions, career opportunities, relationships with colleagues and supervisors, compensation, benefits, work-life balance, and other factors influencing employee satisfaction.

By understanding these elements, we will be able to develop concrete recommendations and actions to improve employee retention, reduce attrition and create a more motivating and fulfilling work environment. This analysis will enable us to improve human resources management practices and optimize employee retention policies.
